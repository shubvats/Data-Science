This dataset contains 1599 samples of red wine and their corresponding physicochemical
properties. The samples were collected from a Portuguese vinho verde wine producer, and
represent the output of their production process. The dataset includes 11 physicochemical
properties, which are fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free
sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol. The quality rating is the
dependent variable and represents the sensory data provided by wine experts. The quality
ratings range from 0 (very bad) to 10 (very excellent).
The fixed acidity represents the concentration of all the acids present in the wine that do not
evaporate readily. Volatile acidity is the concentration of acetic acid in the wine, which at high
levels can lead to an unpleasant vinegar taste. Citric acid is a weak organic acid that is naturally
present in citrus fruits and is sometimes added to wine to increase acidity. Residual sugar refers
to the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation is complete, while chlorides represent the
amount of salt in the wine. Free sulfur dioxide (SO2) and total SO2 measure the amount of
sulfur dioxide in the wine, which is an important preservative and antioxidant. Density
measures the mass of the wine per unit volume, while pH represents the acidity of the wine on
a scale of 0-14. Sulphates are a type of salt that can be added to wine to prevent microbial
growth, and alcohol content is the percentage of ethanol in the wine.
This dataset provides a unique opportunity to explore the relationships between
physicochemical properties and wine quality. It is often used in machine learning and statistical
analyses to predict wine quality based on these properties. The dataset is publicly available on
the UCI Machine Learning Repository and has been used in various research studies related to
wine quality.
